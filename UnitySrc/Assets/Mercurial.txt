ABOUT THE ONLINE REPOSITORY

	Etherea1 source-code is being currently hosted by a service 
	called Assembla.com.

	This is easier to maintain and distribute the source-code because every change 
	is automatically commited to the online repository and becomes immediately available 
	to everyone with granted access to the repository.

	The Version Control System of choice was Mercurial, which is similar to SVN and GIT, 
	but has its own repository format.

	To have access to the Etherea1 source-code updates, you need to install a 
	Mercurial Client software to your working machine.

INSTALLING THE MERCURIAL CLIENT:

		http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org

	The Mercurial Client will create some shortcuts in the Windows Explorer 
	which open with the Right Mouse Button.

DOWNLOADING (CLONING) THE SOURCE-CODE REPOSITORY

	First, you need to get invited to the repository, then you create an user there. It is free.
	If you have been already invited and have created your free user at Assembla.com:

	Create a new folder with Windows Explorer, lets say C:\Etherea1

	After doing that, select the C:\Etherea1 folder you just created, 
	right-click on it to open the Windows Explorer shortcuts, 
	and select TortoiseHG -> Clone...

	In the new dialog that opens, in the "Source" field you put

		https://hg.assembla.com/etherea1-unity3d

	Click "Clone" and wait for the source-code to be downloaded.

	After having the source-code, you can update it through right-clicking 
	this folder and selecting TortoiseHG -> Synchronize

WORKING WITH THE SOURCE-CODE

	Of course you have full access to change your own local repository, 
	but you can't change the online repository.

	So, you need to make another local copy where you can make your changes without losing 
	any of it when you update code from the original repository.

	Just make a simple copy with Windows Explorer to another folder, 
	and delete the ".hg" folder from the copy, so you have an independent place to make your changes.
