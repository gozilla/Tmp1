(1) INCLUDED SCENE:

[W] accelerate;
[SHIFT] + [W] accelerate faster;

[S] reverse accelerate;
[SHIFT] + [S] reverse accelerate faster;

[MOUSE MOVE] rotate camera;
[A] or [D] + [MOUSE MOVE] rotate differently (roll locked);

[SPACE] speed decrease until stop;

[ENTER] drops objects into the terrain (please enabled Physics in the Planet Inspector before using this key)

*** Physics is slow in high tesselation, especially if your videocard does not have Physx acceleration.
*** The included sample does not collide the camera with the terrain (but that is possible).
*** Futurely there will be an alternative faster collision detection that won't require physics to be enabled.


Thanks for supporting the extension!

UPDATING THE SOURCE-CODE

Currently I'm uploading source-code updates to an online repository hosted by Assembla.com ( http://assembla.com ).

The repository uses Mercurial format, so you'll need to install a Mercurial client and pull the source from

	https://hg.assembla.com/etherea1-unity3d

For that to work you need to get invited to the Etherea1 team, so you'll probably need to send me an e-mail
with the buying confirmation from the Asset Store and asking for the invitation.

After you get invited you'll have access to all the updates.
